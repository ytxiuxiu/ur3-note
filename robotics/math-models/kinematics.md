# Kinematics

DOF (degree of freedome) = number of moving joints 

Joints
Prismatic joint - slider
Revolute joint - rotate


DH1: The axis x1 is perpendicular to z0
DH2: The axis x1 intersects z0

Manipulator - A set of links connected through joints
* Base

## Inverse Kinem

redundancy problem, because of the multiple degree of freedome
a robot is said to be redundant if `n > m`
* n - NOF of the robot
* m - NOF of the End-Effector

Degrees of redundancy = n - m
